# News Angle README

## Synopsis

News Angle is a clone of the Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/) functionality, but built entirely in Angular using Ruby on Rails as an API and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Motivation

I built this project while interviewing for positions as a Front-End Web Developer here in NYC. My goal with this project is to show my ability to develop applications using Angular, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. I will continue to develop this application, and feedback or issues are completely welcome.

## Installation

To install this either clone my repo or download it as a zip. In console run the following commands:

```
 Run 'Bundle install' to download all of the required Ruby Gems.
```

```
 Run 'bower install angular angular-ui-router bootstrap --save' to install all our frontend dependencies.
```

Once complete you should be able to launch your Rails server using ``` 'Rails s' ```

## API Reference

This project was built using the following:

* AngularJS
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Bower
* Bootstrap
* Devise

## Next Steps

Currently I am working on the following:

* Down voting
* Error handling using ngMessage for Account Registration and Login
* Allowing users to see all of their own posts when they click their name
* Allowing users to save favorite posts
* Allowing users to delete their own posts / comments
